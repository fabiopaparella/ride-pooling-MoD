# ride-pooling-MoD

Code of "A Time-invariant Network Flow Model for Ride-pooling Mobility-on-Demand" to generate an equivalent demand matrix to include ride pooling in LTI traffic flow problems

## Citing this work

F. Paparella, L. Pedroso, T. Hofman, and M. Salazar, â€œA Time-invariant Network Flow Model for Ride-pooling Mobility-on-Demand", Under Review

## Requirements
Yalmip, Gurobobi

## Quick start

Run in order:
A1 to generate the solution of Problem 2 for each node pair in the graph;
A2 to generate every linear combination of the solution of A1;
A3 to generate the assignment matrix and the pooling matrix;
A4 to plot the results.
